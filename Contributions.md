# Contributions

Any contributions are most welcome. Before doing so, please have a look below for background information on my own plans for the repository as well the guidelines for making contributions.


## Current plans

At the moment, I have no real plans to expand on the repository.


## Guidelines for contributions

If you have minor corrections or suggestions with regards to the existing text, you can create a pull request or raise an issue. If you create a pull request, please mind the following guidelines:

- Create the commits on a seperate branch in your fork of the repository
- Label the commits clearly
- Create seperate commits for logically distinct issues to make the review process easier

If you have more substantial suggestions with regards to repository, particularly on what kinds of additional primers might be wortwhile to include, please raise an issue or contact me directly at **jaburgers@protonmail.com**.
